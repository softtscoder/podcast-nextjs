### The idea behind the example

The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), which is a framework for server-rendered React apps.
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5. If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/interoperability/#styled-components). The project is also built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which is a superset of JavaScript.

This project is a demonstration on converting a figma design to a React app.
